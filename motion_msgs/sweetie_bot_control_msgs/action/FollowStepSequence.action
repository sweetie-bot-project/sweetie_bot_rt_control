# Robot movement presented in cartesian space.
#
# Request:
#  * append --- append this trajectory to previous trajectory if possible
#  * ee_names --- end effector names (the same order and size as in trajectory)
#  * trajectory --- trajectory representation
#  * position_tolerance --- maximal allowed offset from desired position for end effectors and robot base.
#  * orientation_tolerance --- maximal allowed axis-angle errors for robot base and end effectors.
#
# Result:
#  * error_code
#      SUCCESSFUL is returned on success, INVALID_TRAJECTORY if trajectory is inconsistent (unsupported
#      time intervals, nonmonotonic time, incorect vector length and so on), INVALID_END_EFFECTOR indicates
#      that end effector name is unknown, UNABLE_TO_APPEND says that trajectory cannot be appended to current
#      action and TOLERANCE_VIOLATED is raised if psition or orientation error is higher then bound,
#      INTERNAL_ERROR indicate that trajectory cannot be execued due to internal error.
#  * error_string
#
# Feedback:
#  * time_from_start --- current execution time of compound trajectory.
